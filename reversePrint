Given a pointer to the head of a singly-linked list, print each data value from the reversed list. If the given list is empty, do not print anything.

Code: 

    def reversePrint(llist):
    if llist is None:
        return
    else:
        out = []
        temp = llist
        
        while temp is not None:
            out.append(temp.data)
            temp = temp.next
            
        print("\n".join(map(str, out[::-1])))
