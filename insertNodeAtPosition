Given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and an integer to insert at a certain position, create a new node with the given integer as its data attribute, insert this node at the desired position and return the head node.
A position of 0 indicates head, a position of 1 indicates one node away from the head and so on. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.

Code:

def insertNodeAtPosition(llist, data, position):
    new_node = SinglyLinkedListNode(data)
    if llist is None:
        return new_node
    temp = llist
    for _ in range(position - 1):
        temp = temp.next
    new_node.next = temp.next
    temp.next = new_node
    return llist
