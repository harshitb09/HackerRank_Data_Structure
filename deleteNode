Delete the node at a given position in a linked list and return a reference to the head node. The head is at position 0. The list may be empty after you delete the node. In that case, return a null value.

Code:

def deleteNode(llist, position):
    if llist is None:
        return None
    if position == 0:
        return llist.next
    temp = llist
    for _ in range(position - 1):
        temp = temp.next
    current = temp.next
    temp.next = current.next
    current.next = None
    return llist
