Given the pointer to the head node of a linked list, change the next pointers of the nodes so that their order is reversed. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.

Code: 

    def reverse(llist):
    prev = None
    current = llist
    while current:
        next_node = current.next
        current.next = prev
        prev = current
        current = next_node
    return prev
